# IronMic Archive

A static archive site for IronMic.

Deployed to [ironmic.fm](https://ironmic.fm/) via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Usage

The archive site's HTML files are stored in the `site` directory. They were generated by the downloader documented below.

## Downloader

The archive site's HTML files were generated by [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile), which offers browser extensions and a CLI to download pages offline. The Node.js version of the CLI is installed in this project for future reference, and is called through the [download.sh](./download.sh) script which can be ran via `npm run download`. Note that the ironmic.fm domain serves the archive site at this point, so the script no longers provides any real purpose from a non-documentation perspective.

To preview locally, use a static file server like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve):

```sh
npx serve site
```
